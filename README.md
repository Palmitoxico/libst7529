# Driver for ST7529 based LCDs

## Description

This driver has been written for controlling ST7529 based LCD displays with microcontrollers in a somewhat portable way. Still not pretty (almost no comments, and some very ugly code) but I hope I'll clear it all.

## TODO

* Comments;
* Use better names for the functions;
* Use names for the ST7529 register instead hard-coded numbers;
* Allow to disable double-buffering (smaller memory footprint);
* Allow to choose between grayscale and monochromatic modes.

## Supported microcontrollers

* Kinetis kl25.
